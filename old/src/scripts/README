README

I strongly urge you to read the disclaimer, as you agree to it as soon as you issue the
command to run one of these scripts.

These scripts expect to be run from outside the source directory, which should be named
andromeda. They also expect the loop0 device to be free, and that the directory /media/loop
exists.

The scripts in this directory fall under the terms and conditions imposed by the GNU General
Public Licence version 3 or newer, as can be read in the COPYING file in the above directory.

DISCLAIMER!
Some of the scripts use sudo.
They might modify the setup of your platform in ways you might not expect or desire.
I hereby disclaim any responsibility for any damage resulting from the usage of those scripts.

Use them at your own risk
